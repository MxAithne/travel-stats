# MxAithne's Travel Statistics

This is the data and scripts used to track and display my personal travel statistics on my website: http://mxaithne.uk/

## Usage

Data is stored and loaded from travel-data.csv, this currently contains a complete copy of my travel data to date and will need updating to your travel data for use. As it is the code is designed to be embedded into a website built using [https://gohugo.io/](Hugo), to install and use as is move the travel-stats.md to your content folder and put everything else in your static directory. It requires that you have jquery in the scripts section of your website's header, but all other necessary scripts are loaded by the page. It is also possible to copy the code from within embed.html and place in any html file, once again you will need jquery.
